# About ORA

## Our Mission

**ORA** is designed to support anyone entering the modern workforce who wants to become AI-enabled through fast, free, mobile micro-learning. We believe that artificial intelligence literacy is no longer optional—it's essential for career success in today's rapidly evolving job market. Our platform delivers bite-sized, practical AI training that fits into your busy life, accessible anywhere, anytime, on any device.

We're especially proud to offer dedicated support options for service members and military veterans. Having served our country with honor and dedication, these individuals deserve every advantage as they transition to civilian careers or advance in their professional journeys. **We support those who served.** Whether you're on active duty, transitioning out of service, or a veteran building your second career, ORA provides specialized resources, career transition packages, and a supportive community designed specifically for your unique needs and experiences.

**One of our core commitments is to continue providing free learning opportunities to all American Military Veterans.** This isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental goal that drives our platform development and business model. Every veteran deserves access to world-class AI education at no cost, ensuring that those who protected our freedom have every tool they need to thrive in the modern workforce.

Through our dual-revenue model, we ensure that premium AI education remains accessible: our B2B platform serves enterprises and agencies seeking white-label AI training solutions, while our consumer app focuses on individual learners—particularly veterans and service members—with freemium content, affordable career packages, and optional support through donations and premium subscriptions.

**Join us in democratizing AI education and empowering the next generation of AI-enabled professionals.**
